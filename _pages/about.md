Hello! My name is Swapnila.

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer, with a focus on Natural
language processing. I'm based in Mumbai and I
work for [NeuralTechSoft](https://www.neuraltechsoft.com/).

In my free time, I try to upskill myself in my field. Away from the keyboard, I spend my
time drinking coffee and accruing new hobbies (to date: listening to podcasts,
reading about math & psychology, playing games...).


## What's with your username?

I am fan of coding in any programming language to solve day to day problems. 

**_swap_** People call me Swap plus swapping the values of two variables is the first thing I
learnt in my study of Computer Science.

**_stack_** Do I even have to explain? But okay I will.. stack is a Data Structure. I don't have
any particular love for it but come on swap-stack sounds cool!

So, I'm gonna **_swap_** variables and **_stack_** variables all my LAIFU (Life) XD
